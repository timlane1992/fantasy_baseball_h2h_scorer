# TODO:
* Make users refer to players by their baseball reference ID in lineup data
* Package this thing in a standard way (pip-installable)
** Package dependencies
* Make this thing more testable?
* Eventually, provide mechanism for storing, retrieving, and displaying/interacting with results for individual players and teams
* Something that takes in a full team and spits out the optimal lineup? Could be done with respect to the past or (if projection data is available) to the future.
